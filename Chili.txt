Chili – Alton Brown


?	3 pounds stew meat (beef, pork, and/or lamb)
?	2 teaspoons peanut oil 
?	1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 
?	1 (12-ounce) bottle of beer, preferably a medium ale 
?	1 (16-ounce) container salsa 
?	30 tortilla chips 
?	2 chipotle peppers canned in adobo sauce, chopped 
?	1 tablespoon adobo sauce (from the chipotle peppers in adobo) Optional
?	1 tablespoon tomato paste 
?	1 tablespoon chili powder 
?	1 teaspoon ground cumin 



Place the meat in a large mixing bowl and toss with the peanut oil and salt. Set aside. 
Heat a 6-quart heavy-bottomed pot over high heat until hot. Add the meat in 3 or 4 batches and brown on all sides, approximately 2 minutes per batch. Once each batch is browned, place the meat in a clean large bowl. 
Once all of the meat is browned, add the beer to the cooker to deglaze the pot. 
Scrape the browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Add the meat back to the pot along with the salsa, tortilla chips, chipotle peppers, adobo sauce, tomato paste, chili powder, and ground cumin and stir to combine. Reduce heat to low/medium low. Cook for 60 - 90 minutes. Remove from the heat and serve immediately.
