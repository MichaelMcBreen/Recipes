* 4 garlic cloves, peeled and thinly sliced 
* Basil
* 2 (28-ounce) cans diced tomatoes

In a saucepan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until soft and light golden brown, about 8 to 10 minutes.   Add garlic cook about 1 minute.  Add the tomatoes and juice and bring to a boil, stirring often. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes until as thick as hot cereal. Season with salt and serve.
